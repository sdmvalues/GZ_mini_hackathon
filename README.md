# GZ_mini_hackathon - Guideline
Objective: Simple End to End Product including API, Data and Visualization
Ideas:
• Build a prediction model for transaction value, to be called by api deployed in Heroku..output to showcase actual Vs predicted value of 'IDs' in test file

Work streams:
1.  Access data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-value-prediction-challenge/data
2.  Create Flask API
 a.  Add transaction:  adds new record from and to, and amount
 b.  Predict Spent: from all transactions in past, predict future spent per customer
 c.  Show transactions: list of transactions in the db
